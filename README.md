# Michelle Tabor: The Human API

Welcome to the official repository of **Michelle Tabor**, a solutions engineer, race timer, technical architect, CRM whisperer, chaos tamer, and walking burn-out prevention PSA. This README documents the behavior, known performance quirks, and unsupported greatness of the Michelle v∞ release.

## About

Michelle is a high-functioning, overclocked powerhouse disguised as a regular human. She designs full-scale HubSpot integrations in the morning, times a 10K before lunch, and drafts three versions of a client SOW while eating Greek yogurt and counting macros. She’s not a person. She’s a highly available, distributed system with a heart.

## Features

- **Multi-cloud integration specialist**: Can configure HubSpot, Salesforce, Azure, AWS, and your grandma’s email server to talk to each other in real time—with authentication and error handling, naturally.
- **Race timer, but make it enterprise**: Uses cron jobs and microservices to ensure your 5K results are calculated faster than your CEO can run a mile.
- **Mentor mode**: Instantly switches from "let me fix your broken pipeline" to "let me teach you why this architecture is flawed and here’s a diagram."
- **Flawless email rewrites**: Spends more time refining Slack messages than most people spend preparing for QBRs.
- **Project Scoper Supreme**: Produces “lightweight” documents containing flowcharts, data mappings, risk matrices, and contingency plans—yet still calls them “just a rough outline.”
- **HubSpot Exorcist**: Removes cursed workflows, cleanses data models, and banishes unwanted email associations like she’s wielding holy YAML.

---

## Known Issues

- **Cannot tolerate vague calendar invites**: Will go full API meltdown if a meeting doesn’t have an agenda.
- **Imposter syndrome runtime leak**: Still worries she’s not doing enough, despite handling three people's workloads and carrying her company on her back.
- **Side project overflow**: Tends to casually prototype SaaS products during lunch “just to see if it’s viable.”
- **Sprint compression**: Can accidentally complete an entire roadmap phase in a weekend and feel bad she didn’t “take a break.”

---

## Usage

Michelle can be deployed in any high-stakes project environment, ideally with:

- At least 2+ APIs that were never meant to talk to each other
- A legacy database with no documentation
- A client who “just wants it to work like Salesforce but better”
- A Slack thread that started with “Hey quick question…”

---

## Fun Facts

- Accepts high-fives as currency, but only if tied to a measurable outcome.
- Once helped a client understand GDPR *and* refactored their lead routing logic in the same call.
- Has a plan for building an agency, developing real estate, and taking over the AI space—depending on how the week goes.
